Need to set up Google Play Services to utilize Google Location Services (http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html)

Setup Google Play Services SDK

To develop an app using the Google Play services APIs, you must download the Google Play services SDK from the SDK Manager. The download includes the client library and code samples.

To test your app when using the Google Play services SDK, you must use either:

A compatible Android device that runs Android 2.2 or higher and includes Google Play Store.
The Android emulator with an AVD that runs the Google APIs platform based on Android 4.2.2 or higher.
Ideally, you should develop and test your app on a variety of devices, including both phones and tablets.

Install the Google Play Services SDK
To install the Google Play services SDK for development:

Launch the SDK Manager.
From Eclipse (with ADT), select Window > Android SDK Manager.
On Windows, double-click the SDK Manager.exe file at the root of the Android SDK directory.
On Mac or Linux, open a terminal and navigate to the tools/ directory in the Android SDK, then execute android sdk.
Install the Google Play services SDK.
Scroll to the bottom of the package list, expand Extras, select Google Play services, and install it.
The Google Play services SDK is saved in your Android SDK environment at <android-sdk>/extras/google/google_play_services/.
Install a compatible version of the Google APIs platform.
If you want to test your app on the emulator, expand the directory for Android 4.2.2 (API 17) or a higher version, select Google APIs, and install it. Then create a new AVD with Google APIs as the platform target.
Note: Only Android 4.2.2 and higher versions of the Google APIs platform include Google Play services.
Make a copy of the Google Play services library project.
Copy the library project at <android-sdk>/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/google-play-services_lib/ to the location where you maintain your Android app projects.
If you are using Eclipse, import the library project into your workspace. Click File > Import, select Android > Existing Android Code into Workspace, and browse to the copy of the library project to import it.


Referencing a library project (http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/projects-eclipse.html#ReferencingLibraryProject)

If you are developing an application and want to include the shared code or resources from a library project, you can do so easily by adding a reference to the library project in the application project's Properties.

To add a reference to a library project, follow these steps:

Make sure that both the project library and the application project that depends on it are in your workspace. If one of the projects is missing, import it into your workspace.
In the Package Explorer, right-click the dependent project and select Properties.
In the Properties window, select the "Android" properties group at left and locate the Library properties at right.
Click Add to open the Project Selection dialog.
From the list of available library projects, select a project and click OK.
When the dialog closes, click Apply in the Properties window.
Click OK to close the Properties window.

As soon as the Properties dialog closes, Eclipse rebuilds the project, including the contents of the library project.
